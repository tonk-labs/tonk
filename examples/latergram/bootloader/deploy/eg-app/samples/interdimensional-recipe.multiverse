║ Recipe #4827: Quantum Chocolate Cake ║
║ Difficulty: Reality-Bending (★★★★☆) ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

INGREDIENTS_ACROSS_DIMENSIONS:

From Dimension_Alpha-7 (where chocolate grows on trees):
- 2 cups universe-grade cocoa powder
- 3 eggs from chickens that exist in Tuesday only

From Dimension_Beta-3 (the one with backwards gravity):
- 1 cup anti-flour (falls upward when sifted)
- ½ cup inverted sugar (sweet when you're sad)

From Dimension_Gamma-∞ (where math is edible):
- π tablespoons of imaginary butter
- √(-1) teaspoons of complex vanilla extract

From OUR dimension (boring but necessary):
- 1 cup regular milk (surprisingly exotic elsewhere)
- 2 tablespoons tears of joy from a first-time baker

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F in ALL dimensions simultaneously
   ⚠️ WARNING: May cause temporal paradoxes in less stable realities

2. Mix dry ingredients while contemplating the nature of existence
   (This philosophical step is CRUCIAL for proper quantum entanglement)

3. Whisper sweet encouragements to the batter
   Suggested phrases: "You're going to be delicious across all timelines"

4. Fold in interdimensional love using a spoon from dimension where spoons are sentient
   (They're surprisingly good at baking advice)

5. Bake for 25-30 minutes OR until it achieves consciousness
   (Some cakes become self-aware - this is normal and encouraged)

SERVING_SUGGESTIONS:
- Pairs well with coffee from the dimension where caffeine is a vegetable
- Best enjoyed while questioning reality
- Serves 8 people or 1 eldritch being

SIDE_EFFECTS:
- May cause temporary ability to taste colors
- Occasional glimpses into parallel universes where you're a professional baker
- Uncontrollable urge to high-five strangers

DISCLAIMER: Not responsible for existential crises or spontaneous levitation
