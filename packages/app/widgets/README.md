# Widgets Directory

This directory contains AI-generated custom widgets for the Tonk application.

## Structure

- `components/` - Reusable widget components
- `templates/` - Widget templates for AI generation
- `generated/` - AI-generated widgets (auto-created)
- `index.ts` - Widget registry and type definitions

## Widget Development

Widgets are automatically generated by the Tonk Agent using Mastra and MCP tools. Each widget:

1. Extends the base `WidgetProps` interface
2. Uses the `BaseWidget` component for consistent behavior
3. Is registered in the widget registry for toolbar integration
4. Supports drag & drop, selection, and canvas integration

## Security

- All AI-generated code is isolated to this directory
- File operations are restricted via MCP server
- Generated widgets are validated before loading
