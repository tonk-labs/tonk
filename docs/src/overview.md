## What is Tonk?

Tonk is a new category of software that creates portable, multiplayer, user-owned digital artifacts.
It's essentially a file that contains both an application and its data, designed to work anywhere,
last forever, and remain under user control.

## Product Philosophy

Tonk represents a "credibly neutral platform" for building and sharing local software - positioned
as an alternative to industrial-scale complexity. It embodies principles of:

- Malleable software - as easy to change as it is to use
- User ownership - people retain control of their tools and data
- Infinite software in the age of AI - human-scale creation without corporate intermediaries

## Core Tech Goals

- A tonk has instructions for how to connect to its peers.
- A tonk works offline.
- A tonk can theoretically run on any device and be served as a web application.
- A tonk can be shared just like a file.
- A tonk is encrypted and only accessed by its group. (coming soon)
- A tonk will synchronize the state of its filesystem with any connected peer.
- A tonk can be forked or remixed by changing its network or membership group and updating its
  state.

## Key Features

### Virtual File System (VFS)

A document-based storage system backed by Automerge CRDTs that provides:

- Real-time synchronization across peers
- File and directory operations
- Watch capabilities for reactive updates
- Binary and text file support

### Bundle Format

Self-contained application packages (.tonk files) that include:

- Application code and assets
- Serialized state documents
- Metadata and configuration
- Network sync endpoints

### WASM Core

High-performance Rust implementation compiled to WebAssembly:

- Runs in browsers and Node.js
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Safe memory management
- Efficient CRDT operations

### Real-time Object-level Sync

Automatic synchronization of JSON-like objects powered by Automerge:

- WebSocket-based transport
- Peer discovery and connection
- Conflict-free merge semantics
- Offline queue and replay

## Use Cases

### Living Business Experiments

Make your excel spreadsheet interactive then share it with a client.

### Multiplayer Digital Gardens

Shared wikis, blogs, or notebooks that feel cosy like a private chat.

### Canvas Jam

Put TLDR draw in a tonk!

### Collaborative Research Notebooks

Put a Jupyter notebook inside your tonk!
