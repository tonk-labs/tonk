## Template Structure

Each template may include:

1. **Root Instructions**: General setup and configuration
2. **Component-specific Instructions**: For templates with UI components
3. **Specialized Instructions**: For unique template features

## Usage

Template-specific instructions are combined with shared instructions to provide complete guidance for each template type. When working with a specific template, you should:

1. Start with the relevant shared instructions
2. Review the template-specific instructions for unique requirements
3. Follow the examples provided in both sections

## Maintenance

Template-specific instructions are automatically distributed to the appropriate template locations. Changes to these files are propagated using the `distribute-from-docs.js` utility, ensuring consistency across all AI coding tools.
