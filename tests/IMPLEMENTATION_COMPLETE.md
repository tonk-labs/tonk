# Implementation Complete: Test Infrastructure Improvements

## Summary

Successfully implemented the critical phases (1-3) of the test infrastructure improvement plan. The
testing setup now uses the production service worker and provides better isolation.

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Production Service Worker Integration ✅

1. **Created Service Worker Build Configuration** (`vite.sw.config.ts`)
   - Builds production service worker from `packages/host-web/src/service-worker.ts`
   - Outputs to `tests/src/test-ui/public/service-worker.js`
   - Configured with test-specific settings

2. **Updated VFS Service** (`tests/src/test-ui/vfs-service.ts`)
   - Completely rewritten to use Service Worker API instead of Web Workers
   - Registers service worker at `/service-worker.js`
   - Handles message passing via `navigator.serviceWorker`
   - Supports all VFS operations through service worker

3. **Removed Custom Worker**
   - Deleted `tests/src/test-ui/tonk-worker.ts` (513 lines)
   - Eliminated code duplication

4. **Updated Build Process**
   - Added `build-sw` script to `package.json`
   - All test commands now run `build-sw` before tests
   - Updated vite config to serve service worker from public directory

### Phase 2: Storage Isolation ✅

1. **Per-Test Storage Directories** (`server-manager.ts`)
   - Each test gets unique storage: `.test-storage/${testId}/`
   - Storage directory passed to relay server
   - Prevents conflicts between concurrent tests

2. **Storage Cleanup**
   - Automatic cleanup after each test completes
   - Removes test-specific storage directories
   - Added cleanup for service workers and IndexedDB

3. **Test Fixtures Enhancement** (`fixtures.ts`)
   - Added `testWithCleanup` fixture for page-level cleanup
   - Unregisters service workers after each test
   - Clears IndexedDB databases

### Phase 3: Post-Upload Sync Tests ✅

- Post-upload sync test already exists at `tests/tests/bundles/post-upload-sync.spec.ts`
- Test verifies sync works after bundle upload/download operations
- Includes three comprehensive test scenarios:
  1. Basic sync maintenance after bundle operations
  2. Bidirectional sync after bundle operations
  3. Multiple bundle operations without breaking sync

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Replicated Code):

```
Test UI → Custom tonk-worker.ts (513 lines) → @tonk/core
         ❌ Duplicated worker logic
         ❌ Shared storage (conflicts)
```

### After (Production-Parity):

```
Test UI → Production service-worker.ts → @tonk/core
         ✅ Same code as production
         ✅ Isolated storage per test
         ✅ Proper fetch interception
         ✅ Bundle caching support
```

## Files Modified

### Created:

- `tests/vite.sw.config.ts` - Service worker build configuration

### Modified:

- `tests/package.json` - Added build-sw script to all test commands
- `tests/vite.config.ts` - Added publicDir configuration
- `tests/src/test-ui/vfs-service.ts` - Rewritten to use service workers
- `tests/src/test-ui/types.ts` - Added loadBundle and ready message types
- `tests/src/server/server-manager.ts` - Added per-test storage isolation
- `tests/tests/fixtures.ts` - Added cleanup hooks

### Deleted:

- `tests/src/test-ui/tonk-worker.ts` - 513 lines of duplicated code

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No Code Duplication**
   - Eliminated 513 lines of replicated worker code
   - Tests now use production service worker

2. **Test Real Production Behavior**
   - Service worker fetch interception
   - Bundle caching and restoration
   - Offline mode support
   - File serving through VFS

3. **Better Test Isolation**
   - Per-test storage directories
   - No conflicts between concurrent tests
   - Clean slate for each test run

4. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Fix service worker bugs once, tests update automatically
   - Add service worker features once, tests can verify them
   - No need to keep worker implementations in sync

## How to Use

### Run Tests

```bash
cd tests

# Run all tests (includes build-sw)
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:sync
npm run test:bundles
npm run test:stress

# Run with headed browser
npm run test:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
```

### Build Service Worker Manually

```bash
npm run build-sw
```

The service worker will be output to `src/test-ui/public/service-worker.js`

### Run Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite dev server will serve the test UI at http://localhost:5173 with the service worker available.

## Testing the Changes

The implementation can be verified by running:

```bash
# 1. Build the service worker
npm run build-sw

# 2. Check that it was created
ls -lh src/test-ui/public/service-worker.js

# 3. Run a simple sync test
npm run test:sync -- --grep "should sync state between two clients"

# 4. Run the critical post-upload sync test
npm run test:bundles -- --grep "should maintain websocket sync after bundle upload"
```

## Next Steps (Optional - Medium Priority)

### Phase 4: Consolidate Duplicated Utilities

- Create `@tonk/test-utils` package
- Move shared test utilities (server-manager, connection-manager, etc.)
- Update imports in both test suites

### Phase 5: Performance & Stress Testing

- Add 100+ concurrent connection tests
- Measure sync latency (P50, P95, P99)
- Test bundle operations under load
- Generate performance reports

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Tests use production service worker, not custom worker  
✅ Each test has isolated storage (no conflicts)  
✅ Post-upload sync test exists and is comprehensive  
✅ Service worker features can be tested (fetch interception, caching, routing)  
✅ Code duplication reduced (513 lines deleted)

## Known Issues

None identified during implementation.

## Notes

- Service worker requires HTTPS or localhost (tests run on localhost ✅)
- Service worker registration is async but handled properly in code
- IndexedDB and service worker cleanup happens after each test
- Storage directories automatically cleaned up after test completion
