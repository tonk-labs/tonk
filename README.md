**Tinyfoot** is an AI-driven developer framework for building highly personalized software.

In tandem with **Tinyfoot**, Tonk is building a **maximally interoperable network** designed to address the fragmentation of information caused by the explosion of grassroots, AI-built applications.  

## Project Status

Tinyfoot is in alpha. This is a brand spanking new project being built fully in the open. Please [reach out to the team](https://linktr.ee/tonklabs) if you have questions or need support. 

## Features in-flight

- **Local-First Architecture**: Built on Automerge for conflict-free data synchronization.
- **Quick Start**: Create new projects instantly with `create-tinyfoot-app`.
- **Offline Support**: IndexedDB-based storage with automatic sync.
- **Privacy Focused**: Keeps user data local by default.
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern development stack with full type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling out of the box.
