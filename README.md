Tonk is a containerized format, host environment and protocol for multiplayer software you keep and
share like files.

Every file contains both its application and its data, is designed to work across any connection, on
any machine, last forever, and remain under user control.

## What is Tonk?

Tonk represents a credibly neutral platform for building and sharing local software. It embodies
principles of malleable software (as easy to change as it is to use) and user ownership (people
retain control of their tools and data).

### Key Features

- **Human-Centered**: Authority is centered on you, the human using the computer
- **Offline-First**: Applications work whether or not you have an internet connection
- **Multiplayer**: Automatic, real-time, conflict-free sync with privacy controls

## Quick Start

> ⚠️ Tonk is under heavy development. See the [quickstart guide](docs/src/quickstart.md) for setup
> instructions.

Install Nix and then run the following in your terminal:

```bash
nix develop
```
