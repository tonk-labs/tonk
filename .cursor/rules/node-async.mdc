# Node.js Asynchronous Operations

## Callbacks vs Promises
- Prefer Promises and `async/await` over traditional callbacks for improved readability and error handling.
- Utilize `util.promisify` to convert callback-based Node.js APIs to Promise-based ones when native Promise APIs are unavailable.

## Child Processes
- When executing external commands and needing to wait for completion, use the Promise-based version of `child_process.exec` (via `util.promisify`) or `child_process.execSync` (use `execSync` cautiously as it blocks the event loop).
- Always handle potential errors from child processes, checking both the error object in `catch` blocks and the `stderr` output.
- Avoid executing untrusted input directly in shell commands to prevent security vulnerabilities.
