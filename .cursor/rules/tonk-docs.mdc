# Tonk Documentation Guidelines

## Core Concepts
- Tonk apps plug into Tonk stores for local-first data storage
- Apps are collaborative, interoperable, private, and performant
- The Tonk Hub manages apps and stores
- Stores represent Automerge documents for sync engines

## Toolchain Components
- Tonk CLI (`@tonk/cli`) is used to install and manage Tonk
- The Tonk Hub is started with `tonk hello`
- Apps can be created with `tonk create app`
- Apps include built-in AI context via llms.txt files

## Development Flow
- Launch existing apps from the Hub
- Modify stores through app interactions
- Edit app code directly
- Use copilots (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) for development
- Create new apps with the CLI or Hub UI
