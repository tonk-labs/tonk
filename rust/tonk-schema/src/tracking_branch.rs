/// A local branch's tracking relationship with a remote branch.
///
/// A `TrackingBranch` is an *attribute on the local branch entity*
/// that names the remote branch it tracks. `this` is reused from
/// the local branch itself (no hash); `upstream` points at the
/// remote branch, and `origin` points at the local replica that
/// owns the tracking relationship. Asserting a `TrackingBranch`
/// fact says: "the branch whose entity is `this` is tracking the
/// branch whose entity is `upstream`, as recorded by the replica
/// whose entity is `origin`."
///
/// # Why a separate concept
///
/// Semantically this is just an optional `Upstream` attribute on
/// [`Branch`] — a branch either tracks something or it doesn't.
/// Dialog concepts require every field to be present, so
/// "optional" can't be expressed as `Option<Upstream>` on `Branch`
/// itself. Modeling it as a separate concept lets the optionality
/// fall out of presence/absence of the fact: if a `TrackingBranch`
/// fact is asserted for a given branch entity, that branch tracks
/// something; if not, it doesn't. Queries pick it up via an
/// optional-match / left-join pattern rather than a null check.
///
/// # Why `Upstream` instead of reusing `Origin`
///
/// `Upstream` is the direction-explicit "I track this" relation.
/// `Origin` is the ownership "I belong to this" relation. The
/// local branch already has its own `Origin` pointing at the
/// replica; this concept carries both — `upstream` for the
/// relation it represents, and `origin` (reused from the local
/// branch's own origin) so queries can filter tracking links by
/// the replica they belong to without joining through the local
/// branch concept.
///
/// # Constructing
///
/// [`TrackingBranch::new`] takes the local branch and the upstream
/// (remote) branch it tracks:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use tonk_schema::{Branch, TrackingBranch};
/// # fn example(local: Branch, upstream: Branch) -> TrackingBranch {
/// TrackingBranch::new(&local, &upstream)
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Or via the [`Branch::set_upstream`] shortcut:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use tonk_schema::{Branch, TrackingBranch};
/// # fn example(local: Branch, upstream: Branch) -> TrackingBranch {
/// local.set_upstream(&upstream)
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// [`Branch::set_upstream`]: crate::Branch::set_upstream
