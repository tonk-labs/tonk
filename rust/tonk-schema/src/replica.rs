/// A replica — this device's view of a specific repository.
///
/// The `this` entity is content-derived from the `(profile, subject)`
/// pair (see [`Origin`]), so:
///
/// - two devices holding the same profile converge on the same
///   replica entity for a given repository, and
/// - different profiles produce different replica entities even when
///   pointing at the same repository.
///
/// The concept lives on the repository's meta branch. It is
/// typically the first thing asserted when a repository is opened
/// locally: writing the replica record announces "this profile has
/// a local view of this repository" and anchors subsequent
/// per-replica facts (branches, upstream configuration, etc.).
///
/// # Redundant by design
///
/// The [`Subject`] and [`Profile`] attributes carry the same two DIDs
/// that went into hashing the entity. The redundancy is intentional:
/// the hash is a one-way function, so without these attributes it
/// would be impossible to answer queries like "find the replica this
/// profile has for subject X" — you would need to know both inputs
/// upfront and re-hash to locate the entity. The stored attributes
/// make the relationships discoverable through normal queries.
///
/// # Constructing
///
/// [`Replica::new`] takes the profile and subject DIDs plus a name
/// and derives every field consistently:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use dialog_varsig::Did;
/// use tonk_schema::{Replica, Name};
/// # fn example(profile: Did, subject: Did) -> Replica {
/// Replica::new(profile, subject, Name("home".into()))
/// # }
