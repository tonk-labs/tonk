//! Self-update for `install.sh` installs: an explicit `tonk update`

//!
//! Both release channels are rolling tags, so the version string

//! carrying version + commit: the nag compares versions (a real
//! update bumps it, staging churn does not), `tonk update` compares
//! commits (catching same-version rebuilds).
